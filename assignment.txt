FROM LEARN PYTHON THE HARD WAY





Now write a similar game to the one that I created in the last exercise. It can
be any kind of game you want in the same flavor. Spend a week on it making it
as interesting as possible. For Study Drills, use lists, functions, and modules
(remember those from Exercise 13?) as much as possible, and find as many new
pieces of Python as you can to make the game work.

Before you start coding you must draw a map for your game. Create the rooms,
monsters, and traps that the player must go through on paper before you code.

Once you have your map, try to code it up. If you find problems with the map then
adjust it and make the code match.

================================================================================
The best way to work on a piece of software is in small chunks like this:
================================================================================
1. On a sheet of paper or an index card, write a list of tasks you need to
complete to finish the software. This is your to do list.
2. Pick the easiest thing you can do from your list.
Write out English comments in your source file as a guide for how you would
accomplish this task in your code.
3. Write some of the code under the English comments.
4. Quickly run your script so see if that code worked.
5. Keep working in a cycle of writing some code, running it to test it, and
fixing it until it works.
6. Cross this task off your list, then pick your next easiest task and repeat.
